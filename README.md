## Hi, Iâ€™m Terese! 
### it's kinda like "terez"
My passion for web development has been growing!

Recently I've been loving Astro for website building, it's ridiculously fun to use.

A few of my personal projects:
- My [personal portfolio](https://teresemihalcin.com), it's React, made after college, begging for an upgrade
- My dad requested a [website for his record label](https://lunker-recordings.com), launched but a WIP
- A [wedding website](https://tereseandlizzy.love) for my partner and I. Don't spam my form
- A quick [bento style portfolio](https://ematthews.netlify.app) for my partner, for job hunting purposes
- My blog (WIP), A blog is a staple for web developers, but will I use it? I barely post on regular social media

My other passions include volleyball primarily and secondary. I also like bikes, building and riding. Small cute video games are fun.
